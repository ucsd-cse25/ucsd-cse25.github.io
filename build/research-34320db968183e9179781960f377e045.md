# Research

## Study Overview

The instructor of this course, **Dr. Trevor Bonjour (UC San Diego)**, is conducting a research study. The purpose of this study is to understand how students experience an introductory AI course that uses a neural-networks-first approach. The study examines:

- Perceptions of course difficulty, pacing, and workload
- Confidence in learning AI concepts
- How prior coding and mathematics experience relate to engagement and learning

---

## Required Course Activities vs. Research Use of Data

The surveys are **required as part of the course**. However, **using this data for research is optional**.

- Completing surveys is required for the course
- Allowing your data to be used for research is voluntary
- If you opt out at any time, your data will **not be used for research purposes**
- Opting out does **not** affect your grade, standing, or access to course resources

## What Participation May Involve

If you allow your data to be used for research, this may include:

- **Pre-course survey** (5–10 minutes)
- **Weekly “one-minute-paper” surveys**
- **Post-course survey** (5–10 minutes)
- **Optional interview**: You may be invited to participate in a short, optional interview after completing the course. This interview will focus on your learning experience, perceptions, and reflections on the neural-networks-first approach used in the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. These interviews allow for more in-depth discussions and will allow students to share their experiences and perspectives in greater detail. With your permission, the interview will be audio recorded for transcription and analysis purposes.

Participation lasts approximately the length of the course.
